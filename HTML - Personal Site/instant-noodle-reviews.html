        <h3>Instant Noodle Reviews</h3>

        <p>So you're starting your instant noodle journey. Maybe you've only ever had Top Ramen or Marucan and at the most have gotten wacky by dropping an egg in.</p>
        <p>While these brands are a good place to start, there's a whole world of awesome flavors just waiting for you at your nearest Asian grocery store. Just go pick some random ones up.</p>
        <p>Trust me!</p>
